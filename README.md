<h3>Small Intro to Spring Boot and REST APIs Project using Spring Boot, Postman, MySQL, and IntelliJ</h3><br>

Employees have first name, last name, email, and age attributes, as well as an auto-incremented id.<br>
Employees can be created, read, updated, and deleted using PostMapping, GetMapping, PutMapping, and DeleteMapping annotations.<br>
Postman is used to perform these requests.<br>
Employees and any updates to them are stored in a MySQL database.<br>
